# Digital Business Card

A simple static page built with React as the first Solo Project of a React course on Scrimba - [Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)

The markup uses BEM naming conventions to make styling with CSS straightforward. The page makes use of four custom components, an "Info" component which includes the hero image, headings and the two buttons. An "About" component and an "Info" component which both use the same styling with different content. And finally, a "Footer" component which contains the social icons.

The page also has a light mode and dark mode design which will adjust according to a users settings, using the "prefers-color-scheme" media query.
